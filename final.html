			<p>You can still reserve an Apple Watch online and go try it on in the store, but now the page says “Reserve this Apple Watch to buy in store today.” If you have your heart set on a particular combination, that’s probably wise, since the store might not have that model in stock if you just wander in off the street. At $349 and up, the Apple Watch isn’t exactly an impulse buy, but you might wind up changing your band preference once you actually try the Watch on. Now that third-party Apple Watch bands are starting to appear, some smart buyers might opt to buy their Watch with the Sport Band, which is Apple’s cheapest option, although we love Apple’s Milanese Loop and Modern Buckle bands too. We've even got some guidance if you don't know which Watch to pick.</p>
