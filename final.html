        <h1>Ecuador Tourism</h1>
        <p>What is now Ecuador was home to a variety of indigenous groups that were gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the fifteenth century. The territory was colonized by Spain during the sixteenth century, achieving independence in 1820 as part of Gran Colombia, from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830. The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador's ethnically diverse population, with most of its 15.2 million people being mestizos, followed by large minorities of European, Amerindian, and African descendants.</p>

        <h2>Ecuador</h2>
        <p>officially the Republic of Ecuador (Spanish: República del Ecuador, which literally translates as "Republic of the Equator"), is a representative democratic republic in northwestern South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) west of the mainland. </p>

			<p>You can still reserve an Apple Watch online and go try it on in the store, but now the page says “Reserve this Apple Watch to buy in store today.” If you have your heart set on a particular combination, that’s probably wise, since the store might not have that model in stock if you just wander in off the street. At $349 and up, the Apple Watch isn’t exactly an impulse buy, but you might wind up changing your band preference once you actually try the Watch on. Now that third-party Apple Watch bands are starting to appear, some smart buyers might opt to buy their Watch with the Sport Band, which is Apple’s cheapest option, although we love Apple’s Milanese Loop and Modern Buckle bands too. We've even got some guidance if you don't know which Watch to pick.</p>
